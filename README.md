This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Quick and easy! Simply clone the repo and run yarn from the root directory to install dependencies.
**Note: This project uses yarn so please avoid running npm to install dependencies**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn generate:types`

While you shouldn't need to run this as I opted not to ignore the generated TS types, this script
will generate any types relating the OMDb api.
